# HIV_Trend
This project explores global and regional trends in HIV cases from 2000 to 2023 using data from the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Health Observatory. The goal is to identify the countries that contribute to 75% of the global HIV burden and visualize how the epidemic has evolved over time at both global and WHO regional levels.
